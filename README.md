Project Clojuler
================
A misguided attempt at learning Clojure through Project Euler
-------------------------------------------------------------

I really have no idea what I'm doing. Time to fix that.
I've solved more problems than this commit, but most of those solutions
are in a single text file and need to be cleaned up and put into their
own files.

### Seriously, I don't know what I'm doing

If you see that I'm doing something in an entirely stupid way,
**please** let me know. I really want to improve, even if that means
being ridiculed by my grandma.
